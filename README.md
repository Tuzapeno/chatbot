# Guarani Chatbot Project

This is a simple chatbot project designed to interactively provide information about the book "Guarani".

This project serves as a showcase of a basic natural language processing (NLP) chatbot. It processes text from the "Guarani" book (guarani.txt), extracts entities (characters, locations), and uses vector similarity to respond to user queries.

Note:
This project is intended as a demonstration and is not designed for external setup or deployment. It requires a Spacy model (pt_core_news_lg) and a text file (guarani.txt) to function.
